# General

This is an RF simulator that allows to test OAI without an RF board. It
replaces an actual RF board driver. In other words, towards the xNB/UE, it
behaves like a "real" RF board, but it forwards samples between both ends
instead of sending it over the air. It can simulate simple channels, such as
AWGN, hence it *simulates* RF.

As much as possible, it works like an RF board, but not in real-time: It can
run faster than real-time if there is enough CPU, or slower (it is CPU-bound
instead of real-time RF sampling-bound).

# Build

## From [build_oai](../../../doc/BUILD.md) script
The RF simulator is implemented as an OAI device and always built when you build the OAI eNB or the OAI UE.

Using the `-w SIMU` option it is possible to just re-build the RF simulator device.

Example:
```bash
./build_oai --UE --eNB --gNB --nrUE --ninja -w SIMU
```

## Add the rfsimulator after initial build

After any regular build you can compile the device from the build directory:
```bash
cd <path to oai sources>/openairinterface5g/cmake_targets/ran_build/build
ninja rfsimulator
```

This is equivalent to using `-w SIMU` when running the `build_oai` script.

# Usage

## Overview

To use the RF simulator add the `--rfsim` option to the command line. By
default the RF simulator device will try to connect to host 127.0.0.1, port
4043, which is usually the behavior for the UE.  For the eNB/gNB, you either
have to pass `--rfsimulator.[0].serveraddr server` on the command line, or specify
the corresponding section in the configuration file.

The RF simulator is using the configuration module, and its parameters are defined in a specific section called "rfsimulator". Add the following options to the command line in order to enable different RFSim features:

| CL option                            | usage                                                                          | default                |
|:-------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----:                   |
|`--rfsimulator.[0].serveraddr <addr>` | IPv4v6 address or DNS name to connect to, or `server` to behave as a IPv4v6 TCP server | 127.0.0.1      |
|`--rfsimulator.[0].serverport <port>` | port number to connect to or to listen on (eNB, which behaves as a tcp server) | 4043                   |
|`--rfsimulator.[0].options`           | list of comma separated run-time options, two are supported: `chanmod`, `saviq`| all options disabled   |
|`--rfsimulator.[0].options saviq`     | store IQs to a file for future replay                                          | disabled               |
|`--rfsimulator.[0].options chanmod`   | enable the channel model                                                       | disabled               |
|`--rfsimulator.[0].IQfile <file>`     | path to a file to store the IQ samples to (only with `saviq`)                  | `/tmp/rfsimulator.iqs` |
|`--rfsimulator.[0].prop_delay`        | simulated receive-path (gNB: UL, UE: DL) propagation delay in ms               | 0                      |
|`--rfsimulator.[0].wait_timeout`      | wait timeout when no UE is connected                                           | 1                      |

Please refer to this document [`SIMULATION/TOOLS/DOC/channel_simulation.md`](../../openair1/SIMULATION/TOOLS/DOC/channel_simulation.md) for information about using the RFSimulator options to run the simulator with a channel model.

## 4G case

For the eNB, use a valid configuration file setup for the USRP board tests and start the softmodem with the `--rfsim` and `--rfsimulator.[0].serveraddr server` options.
```bash
sudo ./lte-softmodem -O <config file> --rfsim --rfsimulator.[0].serveraddr server
```
Often, configuration files define the corresponding `rfsimulator` section, in
which case you might omit `--rfsimulator.[0].serveraddr server`. Example:
```
rfsimulator = (
  {
    serveraddr = "server";
  }
);
```

For the UE, it should be set to the IP address of the eNB. For instance, if the
eNB runs on another host with IP `192.168.2.200`, do
```bash
sudo ./lte-uesoftmodem -C 2685000000 -r 50 --rfsim --rfsimulator.[0].serveraddr 192.168.2.200
```
For running on the same host, only `--rfsim` is necessary.

The UE and the eNB can be used as if the RF is real. The noS1 mode might be used as well with the RF simulator.

If you reach 'RA not active' on UE, be careful to generate a valid SIM.
```bash
$OPENAIR_DIR/cmake_targets/ran_build/build/conf2uedata -c $OPENAIR_DIR/openair3/NAS/TOOLS/ue_eurecom_test_sfr.conf -o .
```

## 5G case

Similarly as for 4G, first launch the gNB, here in an example for the phytest:

run gNB:

  ```bash
  sudo ./nr-softmodem -O ../../../targets/PROJECTS/GENERIC-LTE-EPC/CONF/gnb.band78.tm1.106PRB.usrpn300.conf --gNBs.[0].min_rxtxtime 6 --phy-test --rfsim --rfsimulator.[0].serveraddr server
  ```

where `--gNBs.[0].min_rxtxtime 6` is due to the UE not being able to handle shorter
RX/TX times.  As in the 4G case above, you can define an `rfsimulator` section
in the config file.

and run UE:

  ```bash
  sudo ./nr-uesoftmodem --rfsim --phy-test --rfsimulator.[0].serveraddr <TARGET_GNB_IP_ADDRESS>
  ```

To run OAI RFSimulator for SA mode, gNB:

  ```bash
  sudo ./nr-softmodem -O ../../../targets/PROJECTS/GENERIC-NR-5GC/CONF/gnb.sa.band78.fr1.106PRB.usrpb210.conf --rfsim --rfsimulator.[0].serveraddr server
  ```

and UE:

  ```bash
  sudo ./nr-uesoftmodem --rfsim --rfsimulator.[0].serveraddr <TARGET_GNB_IP_ADDRESS>
  ```

In the commands for the UE, `TARGET_GNB_IP_ADDRESS` can be 127.0.0.1 if both UE and gNB run on the same machine.

If necessary the user can provide a custom UICC configuration file to the UE with command line option `-O ue.conf`. In case of a multi-UE scenario, the user shall provide a different IMSI to each UE with the command line option `--uicc0.imsi` followed by the IMSI, e.g. `--uicc0.imsi 001010000000001`.

Notes:

1. This starts the gNB and UE in the `phy-test` UP-only mode where the gNB is started as if a UE had already connected. See [`RUNMODEM.md`](../../doc/RUNMODEM.md) for more details.
2. `<TARGET_GNB_IP_ADDRESS>` should be the IP interface address of the remote host running the gNB executable, if the gNB and nrUE run on separate hosts, or be omitted if they are on the same host.
3. To enable the noS1 mode, `--noS1` option should be added to the command line, see again [`RUNMODEM.md`](../../doc/RUNMODEM.md).
4. Information on operating the gNB/UE with a 5GC can be found here. [here](../../../doc/NR_SA_Tutorial_OAI_CN5G.md).

## Store and replay

You can store emitted I/Q samples. If you set the option `saviq`, the simulator will write all the I/Q samples into this file. Then, you can replay with the executable `replay_node`.

First compile it like other binaries:
```bash
make replay_node
```
You can use this binary as I/Q data source to feed whatever UE or gNB with recorded I/Q samples.

The file format is successive blocks of a header followed by the I/Q array. If you have existing stored I/Q, you can adapt the tool `replay_node` to convert your format to the rfsimulator format.

The format intends to be compatible with the OAI store/replay feature on USRP.

## How to use OAI RFSIM with a channel model

Please refer to this document [`channel_simulation.md`](../../openair1/SIMULATION/TOOLS/DOC/channel_simulation.md) to get familiar with channel simulation in RFSIM and to see the list of commands for real-time usage with telnet.

## How to simulate a simple GEO satellite channel model

A simple channel model for satellites on a geostationary orbit (GEO) simulates simply one line-of-sight propagation channel.

The most basic version is to simply simulate a constant propagation delay, without any other effects.

In case of a transparent GEO satellite, the minumum one-way propagation delay (DL: gNB -> satellite -> UE, or UL: UE -> satellite -> gNB) is 238.74 ms.

So, additionally to other parameters, this parameter should be given when executing the gNB and the UE executables:

```
--rfsimulator.[0].prop_delay 238.74
```

Note:

To successfully establish a connection with such a GEO satellite channel, both gNB and UE need to have the NTN support configured.

# Caveats

There are issues in power control: txgain/rxgain setting is not supported.

# How to improve performance

Most importantly, note that the RFsimulator is not designed to be as performant
as possible, nor is it designed to run close to real-time. It might run faster
or slower than realtime, depending on CPU, and by design, as this allows to
stop the entire system for inspection, e.g., using a debugger.

In order to improve performance, you can modify the radio parameters of the gNB
to reduce the amount of transported samples:

- Use option `-E` for three-quarter sampling (also to be done on the UE-side!)
- Prefer smaller cell bandwidths

A possible, unimplemented optimization would be to compress samples.

You can further [tune your machine](../../doc/tuning_and_security.md)

# Beam simulation

RFsimulator supports beam domain simulation.

## Configuration

Several new CLI parameters were added

* `--rfsimulator.[0].enable_beams` : enable beam domain simulation. Should match on server and all clients.
* `--rfsimulator.[0].beam_gains <comma separated list>` : define a matrix of additional pathloss values (in dB)
to simulate the effect of different beam combinations in the RF simulator. You provide a comma-separated
list of numbers, which forms the first row of a square matrix. The rest of the matrix is filled by projecting
these values onto the diagonals, making it symmetric.

 Example list: `0,-2,-3`
 Resulting matrix:
 ```
 [[0,-2,-3],
  [-2,0,-2],
  [-3,-2,0]]
 ```

 The beam gain matrix will be used during beam combining. RX beam selects the row and TX beam selects column.
 Using the example above, if gNB is receiving in beam 1 and the UE is transmitting in beam 1, an additional
 2 dB pathloss will be applied on top of the pathloss from the channel model (if present).

* `--rfsimulator.[0].beam_map <beam_map>` : where `<beam_map>` is a `uint64_t` value where each bit is an enabled TX/RX beam.
   For gNB: Initial beam_map, i.e. which beams gNB transmits/receives before calling beam APIs.
   For UE: Beam position in beam space in the simulation. The UE is not expected to use the beam APIs for now.
* `--rfsimulator.[0].beam_ids <beam_ids>` : where `<beam_ids>` is a comma separated list. Same as above but added for convenience.

## Runtime commands

### Moving the UE in beam space

Use telnet command `rfsimu setbeams <beam_map>` or `rfsimu setbeamids <beam_ids>`. They correspond to the CLI parameters described
above and work the same way.

### Modifying the gNB beam

It is possible to test the beam domain simulation without implementing the beam APIs. The same telnet command can be used
to modify the tx/rx beam of the gNB. The gNB does not need to be beam-aware and use the new APIs. 

## Programming guide

RFsimulator is attempting to simulate hardware device operation, but there are differences. Like with real hardware,
it is expected that you provide the configured beams in `set_beams` function ahead of sample reception. This is due
to the fact that a hardware device will buffer received samples before the driver requests them.

For rfsimulator, as long as the call to `set_beams` with timestamp `n` is done before `trx_read` which is expected
to return sample `n` the beam switch command will apply to the received samples.
